The 'Brazil Risk' numbers, [published daily](http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/ExibeSerie.aspx?serid=40940&module=M) by the [Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics](http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/) from JP Morgan's [Emerging Market Bond Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_EMBI), are a time-series spanning 1994 to the present, and as such, are a great source of data to use for the teaching of time series in R.

## Forecasting with riscoBrasil

The data returned from `riscoBrasil()` can be used with a variety of packages and functions. In this example, I'll use facebook's new prophet package.

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
if(!require(prophet)) install.packages("prophet", 
                                       repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(prophet)
library(riscoBrasil)

series <- riscoBrasil(start = "2002-01-01")

colnames(series) <- c("ds", "y")   # for prophet to work
model <- prophet(series)
future <- make_future_dataframe(model, periods = 365)
forecast <- predict(model, future)
plot(model, forecast)
```

Interestingly, prophet is prophetising an uptick in Brazil Risk.
